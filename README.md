# leaflet-challenge

This project utlised Leaflet to plot recent earthquake activity.  I chose to analyze all earthquake activity that took place within the last day.  This project does require an API key from https://mapbox.com.  Once acquired, the key must be added to the configEDIT.js file in order for the index.html file to work properly.

The size of the circles on the map indicate the magnitude of each earthquake, while the color refers to the depth, with a key in the lower right corner to show what depth each color refers to.  In the upper right corner, there is a control box to select either the Street Map or Dark Map display, and an option to show the Earthquakes or not.  The map may be zoomed in or out, and each circle includes a popup upon clicking with detailed location, magnitude and depth information for each earthquake.
